## Disclaimer

### THIS PROGRAM IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH SONY. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT MAY OCCUR WHILE USING THIS PROGRAM.

## Download

You can download compiled versions of the client from the [releases page](https://github.com/Plutoberth/SonyHeadphonesClient/releases).

**Note:** If you're getting an error like `VCRUNTIME140_1.dll was not found`, you need to install the `Microsoft VC++ Redistributable`.

## Motivation

I recently bought the WH-1000-XM3s, and I was annoyed by the fact that I couldn't change their settings while using my PC.
So I reverse-engineered the application (for intercompatibility purposes, of course), defined the protocol, and created with an alternative application with [Mr-M33533K5](https://github.com/Mr-M33533K5).

## Features

- [x] Ambient Sound Control
- [x] Disabling noise cancelling
- [ ] Display battery life and fetch existing settings from device
- [ ] Equalizer

### TODO: ADD SCREENSHOTS
