## Motivation

I recently bought the WH-1000-XM3s, and I was annoyed by the fact that I couldn't change their settings while using my PC. 
So I reverse-engineered the application (for intercompatibility purposes, of course), defined the protocol, and created with an alternative application with [Mr-M33533K5](https://github.com/Mr-M33533K5]).

## Features

- [x] Ambient Sound Control
- [ ] Equalizer

#### If you'd like to implement the equalizer (I can implement the GUI, you'll need to do the rest), please contact me privately via Twitter at `@Plutoberth`. 

### TODO: ADD SCREENSHOTS

## Supported Platforms And Headsets

For now, only the WH-1000-XM3 is supported. Other headsets may work, but I haven't tested them.

It shouldn't be too much work to add support for a new platform. Open a PR if you'd like to do so. See [For Developers - Adding a new platform](#adding-a-new-platform).

- [x] Windows
- [ ] Linux
- [ ] OSX


## For Developers

`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Plutoberth/SonyHeadphonesClient.git`

### Compiling

#### Windows

Use the provided solution file.

### Adding a new platform

There are two platform dependent parts in the code - the GUI and Bluetooth communication. 

For the GUI, you need to copy the relevant parts from ImGui. 

For Bluetooth, you need to implement `IBluetoothConnector` for your desired platform.
